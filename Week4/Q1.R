#Create three vectors of normally-distributed random numbers, norm_17, norm_30, and norm_300.
#You should tell R that you want your random deviates have a mean of 10.4 and a standard deviation of 2.4.
#norm_17 should have 17 elements, norm_30 should have 30 elements, and norm_300 should have 300 elements.

#Q1 Paste the R code you used to create your vectors into the text entry box.

#mean= 10.4
#sd= 2.4
norm_17= rnorm(n = 17, mean = 10.4, sd = 2.4)
norm_30=rnorm(n=30, mean= 10.4, sd= 2.4)
norm_300= rnorm(n= 300, mean = 10.4, sd= 2.4)
t=mean(10.4)
w= sd(2.4)
