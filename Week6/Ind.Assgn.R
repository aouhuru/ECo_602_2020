#Question 1

#probability of exactly 3 success in binomial distribution
  dbinom(3, 4, 0.75)

#Q2.
  #probability of 3 or fewer in binomials
  pbinom(3,4, 0.75 )

#Q3
  #probability 3 or more binomial
  pbinom(3,5,0.75)

#Q4
  #probability of less 1.2 normal dis.
  pnorm(1.2, 2, 2)

#Q5
  #probability  greater 1.2 normal dis.
  pnorm(1.2, 2, 2)
  
#Q6
  #between 1.2-3.2 normal dis.
  pnorm(1.2-3.2, 2, 2)
  
#Q7
  # a - 1.45
  # b - 5.0
  #ss - 1, draw= 50
  
# the skew continues to be right tailied. The max is the second and third counts. (this is not theoretical)
  
#8
# It tried to me a little more normally distributed with sample size of two
  

#9
  #Because rthe sample size is larger, the shape of the distribution is more narrow, resulting in more precised curve.
